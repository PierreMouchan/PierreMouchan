# Hey ! 👋

I'm Pierre Mouchan, a young **Freelance Developer** based in Lyon in France.

I define myself as *"a Developer with a Designer's Heart !".*

Basically, i'm a creative person with a huge interest in **UI, UX and technologies.**

I'm also a **performance optimist**, looking to achieve *"god"* performances through all my projects.

— I'm currently working on my **portfolio**, on a side-project called **Keplair** (coming soon) as the **Designer and the Front-end Developer. 🔥**

— I'm currently improving my DEV skills on some advanced JS Topics through my sides projects and some research. 👨‍💻

— I'm looking to collaborate on **any projects all around the globe** ! (DM me 🌚 we'll see)

*(A little preference for projects related to JS Stuff 👈)*

— I'm also looking for a Mentor (Senior Developer) specialised in React. 😎

— Currently, i'll try to take some times to learn **NodeJS** (+ Deno), **React Native** and **PWA**. 🤙
